1. The Imitation Game

I PROPOSE to consider the question, 'Can machines think?' This should begin with definitions
of the meaning of the terms 'machine' and 'think'. The definitions might be framed so as to
reflect so far as possible the no rmal use of the words, but this attitude is dangerous. If
the meaning of the words 'machine' and 'think' are to be found by examining how they are
commonly used it is difficult to scape the conclusion that the meaning and the answer to the
question 'Can machines think?' is to be sought in a statistical survey  such as a Gallup poll.
But this is absourd. Instead of attemptiing such a definition I shall replace the question by
another, which is closely related to it and is expressed in relatively unambiguous words.

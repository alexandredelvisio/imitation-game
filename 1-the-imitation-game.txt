1. The Imitation Game

I PROPOSE to consider the question, 'Can machines think?' This should begin with definitions
of the meaning of the terms 'machine' and 'think'. The definitions might be framed so as to
reflect so far as possible the no rmal use of the words, but this attitude is dangerous. If
the meaning of the words 'machine' and 'think' are to be found by examining how they are
commonly used it is difficult to scape the conclusion that the meaning and the answer to the
question 'Can machines think?' is to be sought in a statistical survey  such as a Gallup poll.
But this is absourd. Instead of attemptiing such a definition I shall replace the question by
another, which is closely related to it and is expressed in relatively unambiguous words.

The new form of the problem can be described in terms of a game which we call the 'imitation 
game'. It is played with three people, a man (A), a woman (B), and an interrogator (C) who may 
be of either sex. The interrogator stays in a room apart from the other two. The object of the 
game for the interrogator is to determine which of the other two is the man and which is the
woman. He knows them by labels X and Y, and at the end of the game he says either 'X is A and 
Y is B' or 'X is B and Y is A'. The interrogator is allowed to put questions to A and B thus: 

C: Will X please tell me the length of his or her hair?

Now supose X is actually A, then A must answer. It is A's object in the game to try and cause C 
to make the wrong identification. His answer might therefore be:

'My hair is shingled, and the longest strands are about nine inchs long.'
